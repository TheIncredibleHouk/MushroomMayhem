                to the ground. When your P-Meter is charged, jump up to begin flying. Pressing A

                float, but he can use his tail to whack enemies and activate blocks. He can also charge his P-Meter simply by
                holding the B button. Once charged, holding a the d-pad in a direction and letting go will turn Mario into a fireball
                that charges in the direction held by the d-pad. As a fireball, Mario can break bricks and destroy enemies. If Mario
                touches water in fireball mode, he will be extinguished from it.
