        <h2>Blocked Fortress Entry</h2>
    <p>Each world has a Fortress that is blocked by a set of poisonous clouds powered by the poisonous mushrooms. As you defeat the mushrooms, more clouds generators will become disabled. Once 6 are destroyed in world, any 6, the path is cleared, allowing you to enter the fortress level.
