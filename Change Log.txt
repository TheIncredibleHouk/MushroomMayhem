-Game mechanics
	-Modified the climbing so if you're jumping up, you won't "catch" a climbable tile until your upward velocity hits its peak.
	 This makes it easier to jump up while climbing and jump off of climbable tiles.
	 
-Hunting Underground
	-Modified start of level to include a section blocked by a single brick. That path leads to a cherry.
	-Modified tile properties so the tops of water freeze with ice balls.
