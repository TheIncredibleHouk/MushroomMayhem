    <h2>
        World Map</h2>
    <p>
        Mario Adventure 3 plays significantly different from previous Super Mario Bros. 3 hacks. Rather than traversing the levels from start to finish, the levels act as points between two maps. Note the World 1 map:<br />
        <center>
            <img src="images/mapA.png" /></center>
        There are various pipes scattered on the field. The map is free roaming, meaning you can move one tile at a time in any direction as long as you are not moving against a barrier. Whenever you enter a pipe, you begin a level in an "intro stage". This is normally one screen long and takes you to the main stage. The main stage plays like any other Mario game with coins, bricks, enemies, etc. The goal is to find the exit pipe. The exit pipe will take you back to the map.<br />
        Note how there are pipes labeled A and B. Entering a pipe on the map labeled A will take you to different intro stages which lead to the same main stage. Entering from the first A (from left to right) puts you on the left moste edge of the stage. Entering the second A will take you to an intro stage that leads you to the right end of the same main stage. You must traverse the map by entering pipes and exiting pipes in the main levels of the game. The game can be completely back tracked to the start of the game. Some pipes will traverse worlds, allowing you to go back and forth between worlds as well. This back tracking element plays an important role to complete the game entirely.
        <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
        New Map Elements</h2>
    <p>
        The map has several new features besides the pipe mechanic. Some of these are one-time completions, others can be revisted.</p>

                <b>Invincibility Brothers Toll</b> - These Invincibility Brothers are using the power of the Starman to guard routes on the map. In order to pass by you must collect the Hammer Bros. coins found in the levels. Landing on an Invicibility Brother will take you to a dialogue. If you have enough Hammer Bros. coins, you will pay the toll and you can free pass the route for the rest of the game. If you lack the toll, you will exit back to the map.

    <h2>
        Experience Points & Abilities</h2>
    <p>
        Mario Adventure 3 adds small RPG element of experience points. Killing enemies nets one experience point. Bopping enemies without touching the ground in succession will gradually increase the amount of experience earned as a chain. For example: bopping on two Goombas without touching the ground will net 1 point and then 2 points for a total of 3 points. Chains will be maxed out at 9 total. Defeating bosses will gain more experience. Finally, collecting cherries found in the game will increase experience points as well.</p>
    <p>
        As you gain more experience, you will eventually begin to "level up". Leveling up grants Mario new abilities that he can use in the game. With each level increased, Mario gains one new ability. Abilities can be used one at a time and affect the player beneficially in some way.

    <h2>
        Air Meter</h2>
    <p>
        Mario Adventure 3 uses an air meter. Going under water will cause the air meter to slowly deplete. If the air meter is emptied, Mario will immediately die! Some enemies can also deplete air as well as other environment risks such as poisonous air.</p>
    <h2>
        Coins</h2>
    <p>
        Coins are used to purchase items in the Item Shops. You can hold a maximum of 9999 coins at a time. If you reach this max, your game coins counter (in status bar mode 2) will continue to increase.</p>
    <h2>
        Hammer Bros. Coins</h2>
    <p>
        Every level contains a single Hammer Bros. coin hidden. These coins can only be collected once and are used to pay tolls at Invincible Bros. crossings. When you pay a toll, your coins will be deducted so spend wisely!</p>
    <h2>
        Item Shops</h2>
    <p>
        Item Shops are Mushroom Houses on the map screen. When you enter one, a short dialogue will appear and you will be able to shop. Pressing [LEFT] and [RIGHT] will scroll through the available items with their prices displayed below them. Attempting to purchase an item with insufficient funds will play an "error" sound. Purchasing an item will deduct your coins immediately. The Item Shop's item available will change through out the game and sometimes special discounts can be found at the right time!</p>
    <h2>
        Weather</h2>
    <p>
        The weather effects of Mario Adventure 3 are not randomized like in the first game. However, with rain or snow, there may be be wind involved that can push Mario left or right. The strength of the wind will vary.</p>

        <tr>

            <td></td>
            <td><b>Ice Blocks</b> - These cold blocks of ice can be found in any level and are super slick. Fire Mario can melt these away for better traction.</td>

            <td></td>

        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><b>Frozen Water</b> - Found on top of cold bodies of water, these can be melted to allow access to underwater surprises.</td>

            <td></td>
            <td><b>Hollow Blocks</b> - These blocks are normally hollow until a P-Switch is activated. Once activated, these blocks become solid, usually leading to a secret.</td>

            <td></td>

    <h2>
        Miscellaneous Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>SMB3 Japan Style Damage</b> - By default, getting hit with any power up or suit will shrink Mario to small. An ability can be earned to use the SMB3 US damage system.</li>
        <li><b>Jumping From Vines</b> - Pressing A while climbing on a vine (or other climbable object) will allow Mario to jump off the vine.</li>
        <li><b>Starman Palette</b> - Mario (and enemies!) that are invincible will have a rainbow palette effect applied to them.</li>
        <li><b>Small and Big Jumps</b> - Small Mario's jump is higher pitched than Big Mario's jump sound effect.</li>
        <li><b>Frozen Coins and Ice</b> - Ice blocks and frozen coins can appear in any level type and are slick.</li>
        <li><b>No Lives</b> - Like the previous hack, this game does not use a lives system. Death will cause a decrease in experience points and coins.</li>
    </ul>
