Mario Adventure 3 Code Name ROM Hack
---------------------------------------

This is not necessarily Mario Adventure 3, it is just the code name of a pet project.

What you will find here is a Visual Studio solution containing all of the ASM files of the SMB3 done by southbird. Another program called "ROMMerger" merges the ASM changes from the SMB3 rom generated from the assembler with the level data of MarioAdventure3.nes. Any changes to the ASM needs to be merged with MarioAdventure3.nes. The batch file has been modifed to do this automagically.

I hope to use the version control as a means to track changes to the project and invite others to epxlore what I've done in hopes to get their own ideas or even reuse my own routines in their own hacks!
