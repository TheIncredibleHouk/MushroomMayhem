		an SMB3 map on a native NES, it ought to be multitudes faster on your PC.  But latencies
		or hiccups from the OS might cause delays so you do want to allow a little bit of time
		for execution to complete.  This value is not guarenteed to be precise down to a

		You can set this to something lower or anything below $7A50 to effectively disable this check
		in case it gets in the way of a mod, but be careful in case a generator is writing out of
		bounds and corrupting the game state!
